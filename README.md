# INFOMPR_2_2020


This repository contains the proposal, presentation and paper written for the second project of the course "Pattern Recognition". The code was re-uploaded because was originally uploaded in a private university folder.
Aim of the project was to chose a state-of-the-art topic regarding the field of neural networks and work on that, trying to implement and/or improve a solution for the problem chosen by the students.
Me and my group chose the problem of recolorize black and white pictures. For a detailed explanation, refer to the paper.

The link to the original private repository of the code is here: https://git.science.uu.nl/a.vermeer/pattern-recognition-image-colourization
